00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.040
There are two basic kinds of messages.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.420
Either you send an initial email, or you reply to one.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.080
Let's take a look at a reply in a work-related situation.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.880
Earlier Vance wrote a message to Evan.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.740
And he asked Evan to confirm a meeting for that following Monday.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.560
Now Evan is replying.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.380
We writes:

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.720
Remember to keep the same subject heading on the same thread.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.780
That's a series of replies on one subject.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.040
You can add to it, but changing the subject heading completely can create confusion.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.400
This message is brief and to the point.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.400
The most important information is given immediately.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.300
And yet Evan took the time to be polite.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.000
He wrote an appropriate "thank you" and included a pleasantry.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.060
This message is good to go.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.740
Replying to a business email in some ways is easier than starting a discussion via email.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.500
The first person sets the tone.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.820
So if you're replying to a message, most of the time you can use the same tone that the sender uses.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.780
If they're friendly, you can be friendly.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.140
If they're formal, you can be formal.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.580
Here are some useful expressions you can use in a reply.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.300
Let's take a look at another model.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.380
This one will be slightly less formal.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.980
Here's another message to Evan.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.340
It's about a reference.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.140
Can you predict how Evan will respond?

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.500
Let's take a look at the reply.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.380
Evan replies:

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.180
What's good about Evan's message?

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.820
He used the same subject heading in his reply.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.400
He kept the same friendly tone.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And this message is brief with a clear purpose.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.340
That's all for now. Thanks for watching and happy studies!

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.480
