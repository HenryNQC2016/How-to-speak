00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.380
Hi and welcome to Day 9.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.880
Can you balance a glass on your head?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.680
I can.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.980
Stick around and on Day 20 I'll tell you

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.820
how I learned how to do it.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.020
English with Jennifer

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.720
I've already told you about function words,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.140
small words like AT and THAN,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.980
and how in fast speech we usually reduce them.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.680
The vowel sounds change to a weaker form, usually a schwa.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.740
/ə/

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.260
But even with content words,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.500
the important words in a sentence or phrase,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.760
there can be stressed and unstressed syllables.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.400
As long as we have two or more syllables,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.600
we can have a stressed and unstressed syllable.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.840
Unstressed sounds also get reduced.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.380
They often reduce to a schwa,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.420
but they could be reduced to a short "i" sound.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.560
/ɪ/

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.240
I asked you if you could balance a glass on your head.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940
balance

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.280
The first syllable is stressed. /æ/.../bæ/

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.820
The second is unstressed. /ə/... /ˈbæ ləns/

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.880
I also asked you to stick around to Day 20,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.800
so I can tell you how exactly I learned to balance the glass.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.100
stick around...around

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.020
Which syllable is stressed?

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600
/ə ˈraʊnd/

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.480
So the "a" is reduced.  /ə/

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.320
/ə ˈraʊnd/...stick around

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.460
Here are some words that should be familiar to you.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.260
These ones.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.080
Listen.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.880
Listen closely.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.880
I'll say a sentence or phrase.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880
You try to understand.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.320
Note in that last sentence

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.920
I could stress the word "some" or not stress it.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.940
If it's unstressed, it sounds weak.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.120
/səm/

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.820
If I stress it, I'm emphasizing there are some dances learned, but not all of them are learned together.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.980
Listen again.

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.780
(unstressed)

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.340
/səm/

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.300
(stressed)

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.300
/sʌm/

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.220
That's all for now.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.140
Thanks for watching and happy studies.
