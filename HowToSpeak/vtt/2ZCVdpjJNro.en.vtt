00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:03.660
It's Day 14.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.980
You know what we need to talk about?

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.100
How the word YOU sounds in fast speech.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.200
English with Jennifer

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.840
YOU is an interesting word in fast speech

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.800
because it can change in more than one way.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.800
In fast speech, YOU might sound like YA.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.600
As in, "Ya know what?"

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.160
Or it might sound like I'm dropping the vowel sound altogether,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.620
and I'm left with a Y sound.../y/...Y'know what?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.700
The contraction YOU'RE can reduce to YER.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.120
You're (yer) right.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.400
And the possessive adjective YOUR

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.840
will do the same exact thing, as in, "What's your name?"

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.300
The T and D sounds before the word "you"

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.520
change in different ways.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.280
T before "you" can sound like "chu" in fast speech.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.380
As in... can't you / won't you / don't you

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:30.380
D before "you" in fast speech may sound like "ju"... a J sound.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.380
As in... how did you / where did you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.240
"You" can be said different ways in fast speech.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.540
Many people reduce it with a simple scwha.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.660
So T + "you" can sound like "cha."

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.940
Don't you...don'tcha...Don'tcha know?

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.980
D + "you" could sound like "ja."

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.740
Where did you...wheredidja

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.540
Or even "where'dja"...Where didja go? Where'dja go?

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.620
Note that similar changes happen with YOUR/YOU'RE.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.100
So listen how the T and D change as I read these sentences.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.380
However, many people would choose to read

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.220
THAT YOU'RE with a glottal stop. Listen.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.200
This would actually be my preference.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.320
I think the "thatcher" variation sounds more informal

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.800
and much more relaxed. I would use the glottal stop.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.540
Listen closely.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.900
I'll say a sentence.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.440
You try to understand.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.480
That's all for now.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.240
Thanks for watching and happy studies.
