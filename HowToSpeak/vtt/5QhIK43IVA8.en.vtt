Hey there. It's Alex.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.020
I'm on my scooter.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.660
Have you ever ridden a scooter? It's fun.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.780
The verb RIDE has three forms: ride, rode, ridden.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.760
Alex, can you say those again, please?

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.860
Okay. Ride. Rode. Ridden.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.120
Great. Now can you spell them?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.820

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.840
Can you complete my sentences?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.320
Let's show them the three forms, Alex,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.820
so they can choose.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.080
Alex, can you say the three forms one last time for everyone?

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.000
Okay.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.440
Ride. Rode. Ridden.

What do you like to ride?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.740
Skateboard? Scooter? Bike?

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
Or maybe an elephant?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.580
Bye, people!
