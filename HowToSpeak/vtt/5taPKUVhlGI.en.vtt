00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.580
This is my laptop, and this is the cord.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.820
Is it correct to say "my laptop's cord"

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.600
or the cord of my laptop?

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.800
Can we show possession with inanimate nouns?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
That is, a noun that doesn't refer to a living thing.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.660
I'll tell you the answer by the end of today's lesson.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.200
English with Jennifer

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.760
An apostrophe helps us show possession in English.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.980
So "Jennifer's computer" and "the teacher's computer"

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.520
are both correct.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.120
It's mine. I own this computer.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.400
The same is true for animals.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.580
We can talk about a bird's nest or the lion's roar.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.200
And when two people own something together,

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.100
we still need an apostrophe ( ' )  S.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.880
For example, Alex and Natasha's playroom.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.080
The children's playroom.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.800
The rule changes when we have a plural noun ending in -S

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.300
or when two people own different things.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.020
Similar, but different.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.940
Let me show you some examples.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.220
Which of these two phrases about the playroom

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.920
refers to two or more children?

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.120
The first one.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.800
When you have a plural noun that end in -S,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.500
just an apostrophe to show possession.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.860
The kids' playroom.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.780
Look at these next two examples.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
Can you easily tell which one means

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.960
that the children have separate rooms?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.900
The second one, right?

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.440
If I say "Alex and Natasha's room,"

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.440
it means they share a room together.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.260
But "Alex's and Natasha's rooms"

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.680
means they each have their own.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.220
So now let's talk about inanimate nouns.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.540
Those are nouns that don't refer to living things.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.080
They aren't names of people or animals.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.920
Do inanimate nouns have possessive forms?

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.120
Or can they?

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.460
Yes.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.840
Can we use 'S with inanimate nouns?

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.420
Yes again.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.700
The big question is when?

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.680
When is it correct to use 'S

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.480
after a noun that doesn't refer to a living thing?

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.060
Let me show you four cases when it's common to do this.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.860
We use 'S when a noun refers to a group of people

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.660
engaged in some kind of activity.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.060
It's a collective activity.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.100
Here's an example.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.780
My home right now is in Boston,

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.160
but I'm originally from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.100
And Pittsburgh is a big sports town.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.520
Pittsburgh's love of sports is seen at every sporting event

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.780
when fans wave their Terrible Towels.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.000
Yes, I still have my black-and-gold towel.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.920
I just said, "Pittsburgh's love of sports."

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.400
Why?

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.580
Because I'm not talking about the city as a place.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.020
But I'm talking about the sports community,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.220
a group of fans.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.260
So they're engaged in a collective activity.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.920
Pittsburgh's love of sports.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.440
For that same reason, I wouldn't talk about Boston's weather.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.980
I'd probably prefer to use "the weather in Boston."

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.560
Because in this case I'm not referring to a group of people.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.340
I'm just talking about a geographical place.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.140
Speaking of collectivity,

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.720
don't forget that we have a whole category of collective nouns.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.300
A collective noun refers to a group of people,

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.960
and it functions as a unit.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.060
So consider these examples.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.660
These groups own something together.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.560
They share something together,

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.220
And we show this with 'S.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.980
We use 'S when a noun refers to a time

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:37.580
and we need to express what we associate with that time.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.400
I said I'd give you an answer

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.340
by the end of today's lesson.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.620
We often use a possessive form with TODAY,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.600
YESTERDAY, THIS YEAR, and other time words

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.620
to show what we associate with that period of time.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.840
Here are some examples.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.540
So in all three examples,

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:25.240
it's about matching information or a topic to a time period.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.160
We also use 'S with measurements.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.160
The noun refers to a period of time

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.780
in order to help us measure something

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.500
You'll understand once you see examples

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.060
of how a time word helps us measure an amount.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.480
Try answering these questions.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.700
You usually need to give two weeks' notice.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.500
That's for the first and last month.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.040
Usually yes.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.380
You might get one month's pay, for example.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.540
Or if you've worked at the company for many years,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.500
you may get six months' pay.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.440
So remember we can make a time word possessive

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.860
to show an amount.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.660
Finally, we use 'S with an inanimate noun

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.760
when we're referring to parts of a whole.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.960
Here are some examples.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.040
The school's two campuses.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.620
The Titanic's watertight compartments.

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:16.740
The hotel's 200 guest rooms.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.780
So let's get back to my first question.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.940
Should I say "my laptop's cord"

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:30.060
of "the cord of my laptop"?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.200
It's a trick question.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.000
I probably wouldn't say it either way.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.060
I'd probably use "my computer cord"

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.940
or "the cord to my laptop."

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.040
Don't forget that prepositions help us express relationships.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.820
And in this case "to" nicely shows a connection.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.400
The cord to my laptop.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.420
But I also said, "My computer cord."

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.120
Computer cord.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.060
Nouns can modify other nouns.

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.820
They're called noun modifiers.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.800
Let me show you some more examples.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.340
Now compare these phrases.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.660
Here's one you saw earlier.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:49.460
Pittsburgh's love of sports.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.120
Remember this use of "Pittsburgh"

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.580
referred to a group of people in the city.

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:59.980
Similarly, we can talk about Chicago's hockey team.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.960
The people have organized a team.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.100
But when we name the team,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:12.200
we simply say, "The Chicago Blackhawks"...without 'S.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.660
The name just focuses on the hometown,

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.900
where the team is from.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.400
Does that make sense?

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.280
Just note this pattern:

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.680
For names of sports teams,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.980
simply state the city without 'S.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.900
Let's wrap up with some questions for discussion.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:19.700
If I've made you curious with my questions,

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:23.140
why don't you try searching for the answers online?

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:28.960
That's all for now.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.060
Thanks for watching and happy studies!
